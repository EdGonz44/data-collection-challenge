# data-collection-challenge

## Project Overview:
The purpose of this project was to collect data on mars from a Mars News Site, and a Mars Temperature Data site. This would be done through web scraping tools such as BeautifulSoup within a Jupyter Notebook. The data collected would then be used to do some basic data analysis, through the conversion of the collected data into a workable dataframe.

### Jupyter_Notebooks
The [Jupyter_Notebooks](https://github.com/EdGonz44/data-collection-challenge/tree/main/Jupyter_Notebooks) folder contains the two jupyter notebook files containing the scripts needed to scrape the Mars focused websites. There also contains a folder called [Part2_Output](https://github.com/EdGonz44/data-collection-challenge/tree/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/Part2_Output) that contains the csv file of the dataframe that was created from the data collected through the web scraping in the part_2_mars_weather jupyter notebook.

#### First Part: Mars News
The jupyter notebook: [part_1_mars_news](https://github.com/EdGonz44/data-collection-challenge/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/part_1_mars_news.ipynb), contains the script used to scrape the data from the Mars News Site.

#### Second Part: Mars Weather
The jupyter notebook: [part_2_mars_weather](https://github.com/EdGonz44/data-collection-challenge/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebooks/part_1_mars_news.ipynb), contains the script used to scrape the data from the Mars Temperature Data site. This script also converts the collected data into a workable dataframe, saves the dataframe as csv, and runs a basic data analysis.
